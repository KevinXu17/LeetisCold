## Sieve of Eratosthenes
# https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes
# It does so by iteratively marking as composite (i.e., not prime) the multiples of each prime,
# starting with the first prime number, 2. The multiples of a given prime are generated as a sequence
# of numbers starting from that prime, with constant difference between them that is equal to that prime.
# This is the sieve's key distinction from using trial division to sequentially test each candidate number
# for divisibility by each prime.
# Once all the multiples of each discovered prime have been marked as composites,
# the remaining unmarked numbers are primes.

## logic:
## 1ï¼‰ mark all not primes with their factors from 2 to sqrt(n)
